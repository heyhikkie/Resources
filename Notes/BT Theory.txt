Assignment 1

Introduction to Blockchain:
- Blockchain is a data structure that stores transaction records, emphasizing security, transparency, and decentralization.
- It consists of a chain of blocks, and no single authority controls it.
- Once data is on the blockchain, it's extremely difficult to alter.
- Digital signatures ensure the authenticity and tamper-proof nature of blockchain data.
- Blockchain relies on consensus among network participants for record-keeping, eliminating the need for third parties.

Blockchain Features:
- Decentralization: No single entity controls the network, providing transparency and power to users.
- Peer-to-Peer Network: Enables direct interactions without third-party involvement, leading to fast and cost-effective transactions.
- Immutability: Data written on the blockchain cannot be changed, similar to sending an irreversible email.
- Tamper-Proof: Tampering with blockchain data is detectable, thanks to immutability, hashes, and blocks.

Popular Applications of Blockchain Technology:
- Time-saving: Eliminates the need for central authority verification, speeding up and reducing the cost of settlements.
- Cost-saving: Reduces expenses by removing intermediaries, enabling direct asset sharing, and minimizing transaction efforts.
- Tighter security: Data on the blockchain is shared among numerous participants, making it resistant to cybercrimes and fraud.
- In financial market trading, Fibonacci retracement levels are widely used in technical analysis.

Assignment 2

- Cryptocurrency is a digital payment system that operates without relying on traditional banks for transaction verification.

- It's a peer-to-peer system enabling people to send and receive payments as digital entries in a public ledger, with no physical currency involved.

- Transactions are secured through encryption, and cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets.

- The first and most well-known cryptocurrency is Bitcoin, established in 2009, with a primary focus on trading and speculation.

- Cryptocurrencies operate on a distributed public ledger known as blockchain, which is maintained and updated by currency holders.

- New cryptocurrency units are created through mining, a process that involves solving complex mathematical problems with computer power.

- Ownership of cryptocurrency is represented by a cryptographic key that facilitates the transfer of digital assets without relying on a trusted third party.

- Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology are still evolving, and their applications may expand to include trading various financial assets like bonds and stocks.

Cryptocurrency Examples:
- Bitcoin: The first and most traded cryptocurrency, founded in 2009 by an anonymous entity or group called Satoshi Nakamoto.
- Ethereum: Introduced in 2015, it's a blockchain platform with its own cryptocurrency, Ether (ETH).
- Litecoin: Similar to Bitcoin but with faster transaction processing and innovations.
- Ripple: Developed in 2012, Ripple is a distributed ledger system used to track various types of transactions, not limited to cryptocurrencies.

Storing Cryptocurrency:
- Cryptocurrency is stored in digital wallets, which can be physical hardware devices or online software.
- Wallets can be provided by exchanges or chosen separately.
- "Hot wallets" are online software-based storage options.
- "Cold wallets" (hardware wallets) rely on offline devices to securely store private keys.

Assignment 4

1. Solidity:
   a. Solidity is a contract-oriented, high-level programming language used for implementing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
   b. It draws influences from programming languages like C++, Python, and JavaScript and is designed to target the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).

2. Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM):
   a. The Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) serves as the runtime environment for executing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
   b. EVM is sandboxed and isolated from other system components, ensuring that its operations do not impact your data or programs.
   c. Regardless of how many times a particular function is called on the EVM, it should not affect the system's data or programs.
   d. EVM is Turing complete, meaning it can execute scripts to produce arbitrary outcomes.
   e. It is designed to act as a "world computer" with significant computing power.
   f. Even if an account is compromised or hacked, the hacker cannot steal funds from the Ethereum system because they lack the necessary budget or authority.

3. Solidity Constructs:
   a. Arrays: In Solidity, arrays can be of fixed size or dynamic size. They occupy continuous memory locations, with the lowest index representing the first element and the highest index representing the last.
   b. Fallback: The Solidity fallback function is executed when none of the other functions match the function identifier or when no data is provided with the function call.
   c. Struct: Structs in Solidity allow the creation of complex data types with multiple properties. They enable you to define custom types by creating a struct.
